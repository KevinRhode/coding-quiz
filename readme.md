# Coding-Quiz

## Description

To create a resource I could not only show off to potential employers, but learn and improve my knowledge of the document API. I will be able to reuse this project by creating quiz cards of questions for each of the subjects I wish to review. I gives me a resource to continually improve upon. I learned a better understanding of the document, when to make use of calls, and how to create a interactive knowledge base.

## User Story

AS A coding boot camp student  
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores  
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz  
WHEN I click the start button  
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

THEN I am presented with another question  
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly  
THEN time is subtracted from the clock  
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
